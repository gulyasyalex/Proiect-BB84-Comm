Transmission: Alice sends bits using Basis Z or X. Bob guesses a basis to measure.
2
Basis Matching: After sending ~5-10 photons, Alice and Bob compare ONLY the Basis (Z or X) they used for each photon in the Public Chat.
3
Filtering: If bases MATCH, keep the bit. If bases MISMATCH, discard it. This creates the "Shared Key".
4
Spy Check: Compare a small sample of the kept bits. If there are errors, Eve is listening!
